I created a model from data on over 7300 movies from TMdB, and used it to predict box office revenues for a Kaggle competition. An [interative version](https://movie-money.herokuapp.com) is deployed on Heroku, and the notebook is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/SMSinclair/Predictive-Modeling-Portfolio-Project).
